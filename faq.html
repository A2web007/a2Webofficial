          <p>
           Web design is the process of creating websites. It encompasses several different aspects, including webpage layout, content production, and graphic design. While the terms web design and web development are often used interchangeably, web design is technically a subset of the broader category of web development.</p>

          What process do you follow in building the website ?

          <p>
           We divide the entire website into phases. We start by providing you with website designs to choose from. Once the design is approved, we move onto the next phase of building the functionality in the approved design. The entire website is built on our development server. Once the site is ready, it is made live. We seek your approval at every step thus reducing errors and miscommunication.</p>

          How long does a Website Project take from start to finish?

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
           Honestly, the answer is it depends. As long as it is a simple website, it may take you only a couple of or few days to get over it. But for complex websites such as e-commerce sites, it ranges from a month to further.From start to finish, a typical A2 Web client can expect their project to go live in three to six weeks. Our process involves initial client meetings, project initiation, strategy, creative, and building stages, approval, and then we're ready to flip the switch and go live with your project!</p>

          <p>
           Sure! We would be happy to build your site so that you are able to update it on a regular basis. We will walk you through our Content Management System (CMS), or if you're already familiar with other web-editing platforms, you may use your preferred program for maintenance.</p>

         What about maintenance and security?
        <i class="fas fa-caret-up"></i>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
          If you host your site with us, as part of our service package, we’ll maintain the security of your website and keep the site up-to-date. This means we periodically update our codes & WordPress, the plugins and themes as well as maintaining off-site backups. We also host our sites on well-maintained servers for security. While no site is ever 100% secure, the chosen host, installation of SSL certificates and our periodic updates means your site will be well protected. If a problem were ever to occur, the off-site backups mean we can easily restore the site.</p>
